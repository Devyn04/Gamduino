## Current Status
In progress

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a breadboard, LCD, and arduino to make a portable gaming device. The device will be able to read live inputs and display them onto the LCD based on the input of the player.

## Educational Value Added
1. Develop skills in the programming languages C & C++
2. Plan, design, and implement digital designs
3. Apply the knowledge from digital systems into performing computer arithmetic
4. Translate abstract ideas into functional designs through programming language
5. Develop a deeper understanding of analog & digital inputs, and button debouncing
6. Learn how to use serial communication protocols & LCD communication with an arduino

## Tasks
- Design a circuit board for the button controls
- Create a game that will be played
- Display the game onto the LCD
- Design a display for the point system
